Remove testify from catrate, prompt, and grpc-proxy modules

Convert all test assertions to use the built-in testing package:
- catrate: 23 assertions in ring_test.go
- prompt/termtest: ~300 assertions across 8 test files
- grpc-proxy: suite.Suite to t.Run subtests, mock.Mock to manual
  function-field fakes with channel orchestration

Remove testify and its transitive dependencies from all go.mod
files. Clean stale session targets from config.mk.
