# WIP - Work In Progress Diary

Last Updated: 2026-01-30 18:35 AEST (FILE CLEANUP COMPLETE)
Active Task: Clean up old test files

## CURRENT FOCUS

**FILE CLEANUP TASK (2026-01-30 18:35):**
✅ Deleted old /Users/joeyc/dev/go-utilpkg/eventloop/js_immediate_test.go file
✅ Verified test suite compilation succeeds after deletion
✅ js_integration_error_paths_test.go remains with all tests

## PREVIOUS FOCUS

**COVERAGE ANALYSIS TASK (2026-01-30):**
✅ Generated detailed coverage report for eventloop module
✅ Identified uncovered lines in js.go and ingress.go
✅ Created prioritized test recommendations
📁 Report: /Users/joeyc/dev/go-utilpkg/eventloop/COVERAGE_REPORT_JS_INGRESS.md

**COVERAGE FINDINGS SUMMARY:**

**js.go Issues:**
- 🔴 CRITICAL: ClearImmediate has 0.0% coverage (entirely untested)
- ⚠️ SetImmediate only 60.0% (Submit error path uncovered)
- ⚠️ run() only 77.8% (CAS failure path uncovered)
- ⚠️ SetTimeout only 71.4% (ScheduleTimer error uncovered)
- ⚠️ QueueMicrotask only 75.0% (ScheduleMicrotask error uncovered)
- ⚠️ SetInterval only 85.7% (initial timer error uncovered)
- ⚠️ ClearInterval only 88.2% (unexpected error paths uncovered)

**ingress.go Issues:**
- ⚠️ ChunkedIngress.Pop only 84.0% (multi-chunk path uncovered)
- ⚠️ MicrotaskRing.Push only 92.3% (ring full overflow path)
- ⚠️ MicrotaskRing.Pop only 85.0% (nil task, seq=0, compaction paths uncovered)

**NEXT STEPS:**
1. Review COVERAGE_REPORT_JS_INGRESS.md for full details
2. Implement P0 critical test: ClearImmediate (0% → 100%)
3. Implement P1 high-priority error path tests
4. Reach 90%+ coverage target per T6 blueprint task

**T100 COMPLETION SUMMARY (2026-01-30 12:56):**
✅ Root cause identified: Close() StateAwake path didn't wait for promisifyWg
✅ Fix implemented: Added promisifyWg.Wait() in Close() lines 1813-1816
✅ Test fixed: TestShutdown_PendingPromisesRejected restructured to avoid deadlock
✅ Verification: `make all` passes with 100% success rate
✅ Race detector: Zero data races
✅ Documentation: SHUTDOWN_TEST_FIX_SUMMARY.md created
✅ Blueprint updated: T100 marked "completed" with full details

**BLUEPRINT EVOLUTION (CRITICAL CORRECTIONS):**

### INITIAL BLUEPRINT VALIDATION
**PEER REVIEW FINDINGS (First Review - 2026-01-30):**
- T25 INVALID: No logging.go file exists, no SDebug/SInfo/SWarn/SErr calls found
- T28 INVALID: Close() already blocks on <-l.loopDone at loop.go:1822
- T100 NEEDED: P0 CRITICAL task for promisify.go:56 goroutine panic
- T21 CIRCULAR DEPENDENCY: dependsOn T19 but T19 is rejected
- PHASE DUPLICATION: T64 appears in both phase2 and phase4
- BASELINE INCORRECT: Claims "ALL_PASS" but promisify.go:56 test fails

### INITIAL CORRECTIONS (After First Review):
- T100 Added as P0 CRITICAL task (index 0 in tasks array)
- T25 marked "rejected" with validationStatus and rejectionReason

### SECOND REVIEW FINDINGS (2026-01-30):
- phase1.tasks still contains ["T25", "T61", "T28"] includes rejected tasks
- T61.dependsOn still ["T25"] depends on rejected task
- T62.dependsOn still ["T25"] depends on rejected task

### SECOND CORRECTIONS (After Second Review):
- phase1.tasks changed to ["T61"] (only non-rejected Quick Win)
- T61.dependsOn changed to [] (removed T25 dependency)
- T62.dependsOn changed to [] (removed T25 dependency)

### THIRD REVIEW FINDINGS (2026-01-30):
- T68.dependsOn still ["T25"] depends on rejected task
- phase4.tasks includes T68 which depends on rejected T25 (indirect invalid inclusion)
- phase4.tasks contains MASSIVE DUPLICATION with phase2 (T62,T63,T64,T66,T68 duplicated)
- T83.dependsOn still ["T25"] depends on rejected task
- T85.dependsOn still ["T25"] depends on rejected task

### THIRD CORRECTIONS (After Third Review):

- Personal verification of 7 critical items: ALL VERIFIED ✓
- Three peer reviews completed (first found issues, second found more, third claimed fixes)

2. Metrics sampling interval quantification (no benchmark data for 100-200μs claim)
3. Goja integration edge cases (custom iterators and malicious inputs tested but not fully validated)

## SYNC SUMMARY

**TOTAL TASKS IN BLUEPRINT:**

- EXCELLENT FEATURES: 9 tasks (T42-T50 - already complete)
- REJECTED: 1 task (T19 - OVERTURNED)

**ALL 57 IMPROVEMENTS FROM ROADMAP → BLUEPRINT:**
✓ Quick Wins (T61, others)
✓ Enhancements (T62-T71)
✓ Improvements (T67-T71)
✓ Documentation Gaps (DOC01-DOC05)
✓ Test Coverage Gaps (T72-T77)
✓ Performance Opportunities (T78-T81, T24 DISPUTED)
✓ Security/Observability (T82-T87)
✓ API/UX Improvements (API01-API05)
✓ What's Already Excellent (T42-T50)
✓ Implementation Phases (6 phases defined)
✓ Confidence Assessment (96-97% production ready)

**BLUEPRINT STATUS:**
- Structure: ✅ Complete
- Task Details: ✅ Complete (all 57 improvements)
- Deliverables: ✅ Complete for all new tasks
- Acceptance Criteria: ✅ Complete for all new tasks
- Implementation Phases: ✅ Complete
- Documentation Section: ✅ Complete (whatsExcellent, phases, confidence)

**READY FOR SOURCE DOCUMENT DELETION:**
The blueprint.json now contains the FULL context from `eventloop/docs/routing/improvements-roadmap.md` and is the single source of truth for all 57 improvements.

**REFERENCE:** See blueprint.json for:
- Complete list of all 57 improvement tasks (T25-T87, T42-T50)
- Full task details, deliverables, and acceptance criteria
- Implementation phases (6 phases from Quick Wins to Performance)
- Documentation of excellent features (T42-T50)
- Confidence assessment and areas requiring investigation
- Source document reference marked as DELETED after sync

**NOTE ON PRE-EXISTING TEST FAILURE:**
Running `make-all-with-log` shows a pre-existing test failure in eventloop/promisify.go:56 (goroutine panic). This was identified in T30 (CRITICAL-6 global variables review). This is NOT caused by the blueprint sync operation and remains as-is since this task only syncs documentation content, not code fixes.

## REMINDERS (PERMANENT)

- See reminders.md for full list
- NO global variables, NO global loggers
- Use existing workspace packages when available
- Follow dependency injection patterns
- BLUEPRINT MUST REFLECT REALITY AT ALL TIMES
