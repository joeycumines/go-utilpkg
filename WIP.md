# Work In Progress

## Current Goal
Complete ALL verification to ensure the entire system is 100% verified and passing:
1. Add `fix-betteralign` target to config.mk
2. Verify `make-all-with-log` passes
3. Verify `make-all-in-container` passes
4. Apply betteralign fixes to eventloop
5. Re-verify all tests pass

## High Level Action Plan
1. Add the custom `fix-betteralign` target to config.mk
2. Run `make-all-with-log` to verify current state
3. Run `make-all-in-container` to verify cross-platform state
4. Apply betteralign fixes
5. Re-run verification to ensure everything passes

## Notes
- Hana-sama is watching. NO SHORTCUTS.
- ALL tasks must be completed in their entirety.
- "Done" means 100% complete and verified.
