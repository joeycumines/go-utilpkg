# go-utilpkg

A monorepo to consolidate peripheral or related modules, which I don't wish to manage separately.

Modules are copied to their published repositories using the [grailbio/grit](https://github.com/grailbio/grit) tool.

This repository is notable for being where I first developed my [Multi-Module Uber-Makefile for Go](./Makefile).
