# Usage
# ---
# Extensible multi-module Makefile tailored for Go projects.
#
# This Makefile is designed to be used in a monorepo, where multiple Go modules
# are contained within a single repository. The implementor's primary use case
# was easing overhead of managing many _personal_ projects, as one author.
# The `grit` tool is a key factor in this, see comments in-source, for more
# details.
#
# Go Module Targets
# ---
# Each of these targets has multiple corresponding sub-targets, and with the
# primary target being to run all of them, in parallel, if enabled.
# The relative paths of modules are mapped to period-separated slugs, which may
# be used as a suffix, for any of these targets.
#
# For example:
#   make -j4 $(GO_TARGET_PREFIX)all                                  # all checks for all modules with parallelism of 4
#   make $(GO_TARGET_PREFIX)staticcheck.dir1.dir-2.modulerootdir     # staticcheck in ./dir1/dir-2/modulerootdir
#   make $(GO_TARGET_PREFIX)all.dir1.dir-2.modulerootdir             # all checks in ./dir1/dir-2/modulerootdir
#
# Sub-directory Makefiles
# ---
# In a similar vein to Go modules, Makefiles are also discovered, and exposed
# using pattern and implicit rules, to implement targets to:
#
#   1. Run the default target in the subdirectory (e.g. `make $(GO_TARGET_PREFIX)run.dir1`)
#   2. Run a specific target in the subdirectory (e.g. `make $(GO_TARGET_PREFIX)run-<target>.dir1`)
#
# Please be aware that these targets are primarily for convenience. Limitations
# exist, e.g. each of these invocations are separate, and therefore cannot
# avoid duplicated work, and may be at risk of concurrency-related problems.
#
# Customization
# ---
# The behavior of this implementation is quite configurable, e.g. commands,
# flags, and settings controlling certain behavior, are exposed, and documented
# in the source. Makefiles are also composable by nature, though global scoping
# can cause issues. Be mindful, when choosing how to integrate this Makefile.
# While no guarantees are provided, an effort to maintain compatibility has,
# and will continue, to be made, e.g. as features are added, or tweaked.
#
# Multiple customization patterns are supported, including:
#
#   1. Environment variables or command line arguments
#   2. Creating a ./config.mk (uncommitted, user-specific)
#   3. Creating a ./project.mk (committed, project-specific)
#   4. Including* this Makefile from another Makefile
#
# (*) This is the most likely to break, e.g. ROOT_MAKEFILE would likely need to
#     be set in the including Makefile, as would PROJECT_ROOT.
#
# Make Subprocesses Reevaluating This Makefile
# ---
# Beware: Some targets use `$(MAKE) ... -f $(ROOT_MAKEFILE) ...`, running in
# independent subprocesses. This is intentional but can affect behavior.
# Valid uses:
#
#   1. Target acts as a script with arguments
#   2. Optional prerequisites (not possible using order-only prerequisites)
#
# Details:
# Case 1 is simple convenience - "script" implies no dependencies.
# Case 2 enables multiple configurations/ordering (e.g., `test` standalone
# vs. after `build`). This sometimes necessitates alias targets and accepts
# known tradeoffs like isolated dependencies and potential duplicate work.

#
# Preface:
#
# The tooling provided by this Makefile allows you to publish modules to their
# own repositories, from a single monorepo. This is useful when there are
# tricky dependencies between modules, but you want to be able to publish them
# independently, manage GitHub issues independently, etc.
#
# Caveats:
#
# - Branch selection defaults to `GRIT_BRANCH`. Per-destination source and
#   target branch overrides are supported via `GRIT_SRC_BRANCH.<slug>` and
#   `GRIT_DST_BRANCH.<slug>` respectively.
# - Reverse (inbound) syncing can sync all configured destinations via
#   `grit-pull`, or a single destination via `grit-pull.<grit-dst-slug>`
#
# Configuration:
#
# `GRIT_DST` is a map of _directory_ to _destination repository_, e.g.
# `./logiface/logrus$(MAP_SEPARATOR)https://github.com/example/ilogrus.git`.
# Directories are relative to the repository root, formatted like the output
# of the module/sub-Makefile discovery, i.e. "." or "./path/to/dir". Each
# directory is converted to a grit slug, using the same convention as
# elsewhere (leading "./" removed, "/" replaced with SLUG_SEPARATOR, "." mapped
# to "root"), which is used as the target suffix, e.g. `grit.logiface.logrus`.
# N.B. Grit destinations are a wholly separate namespace: they need not be Go
# modules, and Go modules without a `GRIT_DST` entry get no grit targets.
#
# `GRIT_BRANCH` (default "main") is the fallback branch for endpoints. Optional
# `GRIT_SRC_BRANCH.<slug>` and `GRIT_DST_BRANCH.<slug>` variables override the
# source (this repository) and destination (target repository) branches.
#
# Usage:
#
# 1. Prepare the target repository (presumably the canonical one per go.mod)
# 2. Update `project.mk`, setting `GRIT_SRC` (if you haven't already) and
#   `GRIT_DST`, optionally setting `GRIT_BRANCH` (defaults to "main") and
#   per-destination branch overrides like `GRIT_SRC_BRANCH.eventloop`
# 3. Sync _from_ the target to the source (this repository) like
#   `make grit-init GRIT_INIT_TARGET=grit-dst-slug`, where grit-dst-slug is the
#   slug of the directory used as the map key, in GRIT_DST, note that you may
#   need to specify GRIT_FLAGS='-push -linearize' (see the docs)
# 4. Add the new module to the Go workspace
# 5. Run (either automatically or manually) `make grit` to sync _to_ the
#   configured target(s), to propagate
# 6. To sync existing destinations back into this repository, on demand,
#   run `make grit-pull` (or `make grit-pull.<grit-dst-slug>`)

# simple variables that either represent invariants, or need to be interacted
# with in an imperative manner, e.g. "building" values across includes, without
# separating the output of each include into its own discrete variable

# hence the simple variable assignment, prior to any includes
